Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as Data Analyst at Accenture. Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions. Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.

Findings:

Our analysis revealed a total of 16 unique post categories, with significant engagement observed in categories such as Animals, Science, and Healthy Eating. Notably, the Animal category garnered the highest attention, with 1,897 reactions recorded. Moreover, there was a clear preference for factual content, as evidenced by the popularity of Science and Technology categories.

Furthermore, we identified the top five most popular categories of posts, namely Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food, with Animals emerging as the clear frontrunner. This distribution underscores the importance of maintaining a balanced content ecosystem to prevent disproportionate emphasis on any single category.

In addition, our analysis provided valuable insights into user behavior trends. For instance, January emerged as the most common month for user posts, aligning with seasonal trends following calendar events like Christmas. This understanding of temporal patterns can guide content scheduling strategies to optimize user engagement throughout the year.

Moreover, our examination of the popularity distribution among the top five categories revealed interesting nuances. While engagement across categories showed minimal variance, Animals exhibited a significant lead over the second-most popular category. This highlights the importance of diversity in content offerings to effectively cater to a broad user base.

In conclusion, our analysis not only unveiled the top-performing content categories but also provided actionable insights to enhance user engagement. As we transition from analysis to implementation, Accenture is poised to support in leveraging these insights for real-time decision-making and organizational performance optimization.
